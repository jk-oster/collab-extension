You also don't need to set up multiple accounts across the multiple websites that you frequent!\n- Anonymous chat if you want to or choose what information to make public.\n- Website owners and power users can \"lurk\" on Sidechat to provide guidance or tech support to other visitors at any time.\n- Increase and improve productivity by getting more out of every website you visit.\n- Community members of hobbyist websites can stay on Sidechat to provide guidance (without new users having to register to the website community). \n- Be one of the first to try Sidechat.\n- Experience a new way to use the internet.\n- You no longer have to browse alone.\n- You no longer need permission from gatekeepers like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Gmail, etc, in order to connect & communicate with other members.\n- Patent Pending Technology\n- 5-star reviews.\n- Social Browsing is the next Social Networking.\n\nSidechat alerts you when someone else is currently browsing on the same website as you and allows you to chat online or message online with each other through a Sidechat window (popup) that sits on top of your browser. \n\nSidechat is a free chromestore (chrome web store) chat alternative that increases and improves your productivity online by allowing you to get more out of every website you visit, creating a collaborative and shared browsing experience.\n\nYou don't have to browse the web alone. Increase and improve your productivity while browsing online by connecting and chatting (messaging) with like-minded people around the world who are online browsing the same website and resources as you. \n\nWhether you’re working on a project, following a tutorial and have questions, watching a video on Youtube, or are an e-commerce customer that needs help before purchasing a product, Sidechat is the perfect solution to increase productivity, easily collaborate, connect & communicate, message and chat with strangers who also are like-minded people.\n\nHOW TO USE SIDECHAT\n- Click \"Add to Chrome\".\n- Log in to Sidechat from the extension menu.\n- Under Profile, choose the information you would like to make public.\n- Browse the web normally and Sidechat will automatically alert you when it finds another Sidechat user visiting the same webpage as you.\n- Click on the person's profile picture to see their profile details.\n- Click on the chat icon to chat with the person.\n- Open your “Chats” screen to see all your previous chat statuses.\n- Go offline/online without having to delete or reinstall the Sidechat extension\n- Connect on the domain level or dive deeper and connect on the actual page level within a domain.\n\nSIDECHAT BENEFITS\n▶️ Watching a video on Youtube or Netflix web player? With Sidechat you can discuss the current video you're watching with other viewers in real-time.\n\n🛒 Shoppers can use Sidechat to connect & communicate with other shoppers visiting a product page on Amazon or Shopify and start a conversation or ask questions before they buy.\n\n🎧 Listening to that new Drake album on Spotify? Get to know who else is a Drake Stan and start chatting with people listening to the same album as you.\n\n😤 Hate paying commission and fees on eBay, Etsy, Amazon, OfferUp, etc? Use Sidechat to connect & communicate with potential customers visiting your page and keep all the revenue.\n\n💻 Software developers can connect & communicate with other programmers visiting the same StackOverflow answer page or a GitHub repo and collaborate to improve productivity. \n\n❤️ Tired of browsing alone? Sidechat is the perfect extension for finding your future soulmate. Sidechat shows you who else nearby is currently browsing the same website as you, and lets you strike up a conversation if they're cute enough! \"Hey, I noticed you were browsing the same website as me. Wanna chat about it?\"\n\n🏠 With Sidechat, Realtors can connect & communicate directly with active home buyers or other real estate professionals browsing Zillow or Redfin without having to pay a steep fee. \n\n🧑‍💼 Multiple employees browsing the same website at the same time can chat, collaborate and share insights, which will help improve productivity by reducing the amount of time wasted on browsing websites for information or resources.\n\n👋 We built Sidechat as a way for freelancers and clients to connect & communicate on top of Fiverr or Upwork as opposed to within Fiverr or Upwork, thereby avoiding the steep fees and commissions charged by both platforms.\n\n🌳 Perhaps you're both on an outdoors website because you both love RVs and camping.\n\n💰 Maybe you would like to skip Amazon, Etsy, or eBay fees and just transact directly.  \n\nWhatever the case may be, Sidechat opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities for connecting, e-commerce, making friends, dating, and finding common interests. Right now, there are other like-minded people on this exact webpage you are currently visiting. You may not see them, but with Sidechat, you can chat, message, and collaborate with them in real-time.\n\nWHAT USERS ARE SAYING\n 📢 \"Woah this is a game changer. Great idea!

Once created, you can log in and start using Sidechat to connect & communicate, chat, collaborate and increase your productivity while browsing the web.\n\nUPCOMING FEATURES\n💡 Clickable links in the chat.\n💡 Emojis, gifs, and images in the chat.\n💡 @Usernames.\n💡 Turn the notification sound off.\n💡 Google Login/Signup.\n💡 Email verification and password reset.\n💡 Ability to block/delete users.\n💡 Dark/Quiet Mode.\n💡 Whitelist websites.\n💡 Language localization.\n💡 Verified badges for website owners.\n💡 Firefox, Edge & Safari versions.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n🟩 How does Sidechat work?\nThe extension has 3 tabs, a \"Home\" tab for everyone on the extension currently browsing the same page as you, a \"Chats\" tab for everyone you have previously chatted with, and then a \"Profile\" tab for you to edit your profile and control your privacy settings. \n\n🟩 How do I change my profile photo?\nTo change your profile photo, you simply click on the 'Choose File' button and it will launch your local directory folder. There you can select the photo you want to make as your profile photo and then click the 'Upload Photo' button. That's all. \n\n🟩 I just logged in and my Chats or Profile screen is empty\nThis is a known bug we are working on. Simply reload/refresh the popup window and you will be able to see your Profile screen and any Chats screen information.\n\n🟩 What information do you store?\nWe store the URL you are on when you send a message so we can identify other users to connect you with, based on the domain and webpage. We also store your chat history in order to present it to you in a threaded conversation dialogue on the \"Chats\" screen. Other than that, we have no idea what you’re doing unless you decide to use the extension. You can read our Privacy Policy below or contact us at support@sidechat.io to learn more.\n\n🟩 Is there anywhere that we can report bugs or give recommendations?\nYES! Please report bugs to support@sidechat.io and we will get back to you within 24 hours. If you have any feedback, thoughts, suggestions or anything else, please feel free to email me us at support@sidechat.io and we will get back to you within 24 hours.\n\n🟩 Are there any websites where you recommend testing it out?\nYES! www.google.com is our most active site fr obvious reasons. You can also try www.youtube.com and www.amazon.com. \n\n🟩 Does Sidechat work on every website?\nYES! Sidechat works on every website and webpage you can visit from your browser! Sidechat is still new and so you might not find someone on every site, but if you invite your friends, you can both try it out on any site.\n\n🟩 How do you deal with spam?\nThis is a potential issue that we have been thinking about from the start. Fortunately, we do not yet have that problem. However, we intentionally made all chats 1-to-1 in order to reduce the propensity for spamming. In future updates, we will add a Block/Delete button that will allow users to simply temporarily block another user that has messaged them, or delete them permanently from their chats.\n\n🟩 Is there a Firefox version?\nNot yet but we are working on it.\n\nSIDECHAT PRIVACY & SAFETY\nBy installing the Sidechat extension, you agree to our Privacy Policy (https://volty.tv/privacy-policy/index.html). \n\nSidechat processes personal data in accordance with European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016. Sidechat’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use comply fully with GDPR, which is the toughest privacy and security law in the world.\n\nGot question? Drop us a line at support@sidechat.io!\n\n************************\nUPDATES - 04/05/22\n************************\nThis update requires you re-register your account due to a needed database reconfiguration.  \n\n⭐️ Feature request: Message timestamp should be represented as how long ago it was sent.\n✔️Resolution: Changed message timestamp from machine UTC to \"how long ago it was sent\".\n\n⭐️Feature request: Age and gender should be optional.\n✔️Resolution: Age already had the option to switch between public and private. Changed gender from default public to switchable between public and private. \n\n⭐️Some minor bug fixes.\n\n************************\nUPDATES - 04/13/22\n************************\n\n⭐️Feature request: It's going to get annoying in a hurry the way that the extension pops up to let you know that no one is on the site when you have unread messages. I'd personally make it so it only pops up when users are on the site. \n✔️Resolution: The popup was previously activated if only one of two conditions were met namely:\n1.) If there is another person found browsing the same page as you, \n2.) If you have an unread message in the 'Chats' tab.\nStopped using the popup window as an alert for unread messages and instead added a notification alert badge on the Sidechat icon in the browser header. \n\n⭐️Feature request: It's not very clear how you change the profile photo.\n✔️Resolution: Moved photo upload settings to the top of the Profile page and added a large 'Upload Photo' button.\n\n⭐️Some minor bug fixes.\n\nWe are always working to improve Sidechat and give you a 5 STAR ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ EXPERIENCE!! We would really appreciate a review if you have a minute or two.",

Share your browser tab with friends, colleagues, or family. \n\n🎯 Research with Dropzone\nWhile you browse, drag and drop stuff from around the web into the dropzone. Text, images, links. In a multi-user browsing session it's synced in real-time with everyone. Export your research as a PDF, via email, or copy as Markdown to your note-taking app.\n\n💻Not screen sharing\nCollaborate without staring at someone else's screen in a window. On the same page as others, but in the comfort of your own browser! \n\n🔒 Privacy first\nNo browsing activity is stored or tracked with tbx. You choose who to browse with, and on which page. Because tbx doesn't share your screen, it also means any sensitive data is for your eyes only. If you use the dropzone for your online research, tbx doesn't keep any of your dropzone contents.\n\n💡 tbx an experiment in Internet connectivity and collaboration, to make the web more human and connected. It's a project by an indie developer (Slav). \nYou can leave feedback and support the project by joining the groups:\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/GZX3uuU\n- Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/Bu_6qhL1RRAqpM5SoOk1cA\n\nBeta updates\n---------------------\nNew in 0.3.3:\n- Notes in the dropzone now show the source as a link, so you can come back to the page where you got the note from. It's also shown in the email, Markdown and PDF. \n- Fixed an issue where some images weren't being added to PDFs\n\nNew in 0.3.1:\n- Added the ability to delete items from the dropzone\n- Added a button to add the current tab URL to 'Links' section in the dropzone\n\nNew in 0.3.0:\n- Dropzone: you can now drag & drop text, links, and images into the dropzone - a little container that stays with you while you research onlin. If you invite people into the session, the dropzone is synced in real-time. Once you're done browsing, you can email the contents, copy to Markdown, or save as a PDF. Neat! \n- Single-user mode: you can start a session without inviting people. Great for going into solo research mode. \n- The overlay can now be hidden from view if you need. In the session, go to three-dot menu -> Auto-hide overlay. \n- Many fixes and improvements.\n\nNew in 0.2.0:\n- More intuitive things: A new popup window redesign. Teams is replaced by 'Contacts', so now inviting people is even easier than before. \n- You can now scroll to where users are by clicking on their avatar in the session.\n- Easier to identify which tab is in a session: the favicon of the current website is now badged with a bright green circle. \n\nNew in 0.1.2:\n- Follow mode! When the leader changes URL - everyone follows, if they have follow mode turned on. \n\nThanks for using tbx!",
